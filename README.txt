***** USAGE *****
This is intended to make it easier to build installation profiles.  By itself it doesn't do anything useful but with the Profiler module it is awesome-sauce.

Install this module, then go to admin/settings/profiler_builder . This will take your current installation and attempt to turn it into the files needed for use in profiler.

Clean up the generated output based on what you actually want to include in your profile / distribution and off you go!
